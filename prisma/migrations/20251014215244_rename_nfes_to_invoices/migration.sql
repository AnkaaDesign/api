-- This migration renames the Prisma relation names from "nfes" to "invoices" and "nfeReimbursements" to "invoiceReimbursements"
-- These are TypeScript/Prisma-level changes only and do not require database schema changes
-- The actual database foreign key relationships remain unchanged

-- No database schema changes required
